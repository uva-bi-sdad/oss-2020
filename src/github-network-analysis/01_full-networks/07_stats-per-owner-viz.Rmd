Next, let's look at descriptives per contributor. 

First, we have to write a desc_ctrs_summary table to the database... 

```{sql}

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW gh.desc_owners_summary AS (
SELECT split_part(slug, '/', 1) AS owner, COUNT(DISTINCT slug) AS repos, COUNT(*) AS commits, SUM(additions) AS additions, SUM(deletions) AS deletions
FROM gh.commits_pre 
GROUP BY owner
); 

```

And pull that into R. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())

# load packages 
for (pkg in c("tidyverse", "data.table", "R.utils", "RPostgreSQL", "treemap",
              "cowplot", "maditr", "lubridate")) {library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)}

# connect to postgresql to get data (in rivanna)
conn <- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), 
                  dbname = "sdad", 
                  host = "10.250.124.195", 
                  port = 5432, 
                  user = Sys.getenv("db_userid"), 
                  password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"))

# grab the licenses data 
owners_summary <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT owner, repos, commits, additions, deletions  
                                  FROM gh.desc_owners_summary")

# disconnect from postgresql
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

```{r}
# group_by login and get total users_per_repo
repos_per_owner <- owners_summary %>% 
  group_by(repos) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  rename(totals = n) %>% 
  filter(repos != 0)  

repos_per_owner

# recode user ranges into categories  
repos_per_owner$repos <- cut(repos_per_owner$repos, 
                            breaks=c(0,1,3,5,20,100000), 
                            labels=c("1", "2-3", "4-5", "6-20", "21+"))
# get the percentage breakdowns
summarized_breakdown <- repos_per_owner %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(repos) %>% 
  mutate(new_totals = sum(totals)) %>% 
  select(-totals) %>%   
  distinct(repos, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(new_totals * 100 / sum(repos_per_owner$totals), 2))
sum(summarized_breakdown$percent)
summarized_breakdown
```

Then, we graph those results and beautify the graph a little bit. 

```{r users_per_repo_graph}

# create a color palette
uva_colors <- c(
  `dark red`    = "#990000",
  `orange`      = "#E57200",
  `yellow`      = "#eaaa31",
  `green`       = "#1d7c6b",
  `dark blue`   = "#232D4B", 
  `light blue`  = "#628ed8", 
  #`pink`        = "#7f345a",
  `purple`      = "#4c1f36")

# a function that extracts the hex codes from this vector by name
uva_cols <- function(...) {
  cols <- c(...)
  if (is.null(cols))
    return (uva_colors)
  uva_colors[cols]
}

# create labels for our graph
df <- cbind.data.frame(c("1 repo\n(58.2%)",
                         "2-3 repos\n(24.3%)",
                         "4-5 repos\n(7.6%)",
                         "6-20 repos\n(8.8%)", 
                         "21+ repos (1.1%)"),
                         summarized_breakdown$new_totals)
colnames(df) <- c("repos", "totals")

# apply the palette to the graph 
pal <- c(uva_cols("dark blue"),       # 1 ctr
         #uva_cols("pink"),     # 2 ctrs
         uva_cols("dark red"),
         uva_cols("yellow"),
              # 11-50 ctrs 
         uva_cols("light blue"),
         uva_cols("orange"),
         
          
         #uva_cols("orange"),        # 201-1000
         #uva_cols("purple"),
         uva_cols("yellow")
         )     # 3-5 ctrs

# create the tree map 
treemap::treemap(df, 
        index="repos", 
        vSize="totals",
        palette = pal, 
        title="Number of repositories per repo owner (All GitHub Data, 2008-19)",
        fontsize.labels=c(12,1,1,1,1,1,1,1), 
        fontsize.title=15)

```
